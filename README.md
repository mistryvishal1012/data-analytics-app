## Objective
# Develop a Python-based data analytics application and implement a complete CI/CD pipeline using Docker, Minikube, Jenkins, and other tools. The pipeline will automate the building, testing, deploying, and monitoring processes.

# Technologies Used
Version Control: GitHub
Containerization: Docker
Orchestration: Minikube (Kubernetes)
Operating System: Ubuntu
CI/CD Tool: Jenkins
Build Tool: Maven (optional)
Testing Tools: Pytest, Selenium (if using a web interface)
Configuration Management: Ansible or Chef
Monitoring: AWS CloudWatch

# Prerequisites
Basic understanding of Python programming.
Familiarity with Git and GitHub for version control.
Basic knowledge of Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and cloud services.

# Assignment Steps
1. Project Setup on GitHub
Summary:
Initialize a GitHub repository for managing your project code and configuration files. Create and clone the repository, establish the project structure, and add sample data for analytics.

2. Develop the Application
Summary:
Develop a Python application to perform data analytics. Set up a virtual environment, install required dependencies, and implement the core logic for data processing and analysis.

3. Containerization with Docker
Summary:
Containerize the application using Docker. Write a Dockerfile to define the application environment, build the Docker image, and run the container to ensure functionality.

4. CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins
Summary:
Set up Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. Install Jenkins, configure necessary plugins, create a Jenkinsfile to define pipeline stages, and set up a Jenkins job connected to your GitHub repository.

5. Testing with Pytest and Selenium
Summary:
Implement automated testing to ensure the application operates correctly. Write tests using Pytest for backend functionality and Selenium for web interface testing, if applicable.

6. Deployment with Minikube
Summary:
Deploy the application to a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube. Install and start Minikube, create Kubernetes manifests for deployment and services, and apply them to the cluster.

7. Configuration Management with Ansible or Chef
Summary:
Automate server configuration and deployment using Ansible or Chef. Develop playbooks or recipes to handle installation and deployment tasks.
