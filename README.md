## Objective
### Develop a Python-based data analytics application and implement a complete CI/CD pipeline using Docker, Minikube, Jenkins, and other tools. The pipeline will automate the building, testing, deploying, and monitoring processes.


# Prerequisites
Basic understanding of Python programming.
Familiarity with Git and GitHub for version control.
Basic knowledge of Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and cloud services.

# Assignment Steps
1. Project Setup on GitHub
Summary:
Initialize a GitHub repository for managing your project code and configuration files. Create and clone the repository, establish the project structure, and add sample data for analytics.

2. Develop the Application
Summary:
Develop a Python application to perform data analytics. Set up a virtual environment, install required dependencies, and implement the core logic for data processing and analysis.

3. Containerization with Docker
Summary:
Containerize the application using Docker. Write a Dockerfile to define the application environment, build the Docker image, and run the container to ensure functionality.

4. CI/CD Pipeline with Jenkins
Summary:
Set up Jenkins to automate the build, test, and deployment processes. Install Jenkins, configure necessary plugins, create a Jenkinsfile to define pipeline stages, and set up a Jenkins job connected to your GitHub repository.

5. Testing with Pytest and Selenium
Summary:
Implement automated testing to ensure the application operates correctly. Write tests using Pytest for backend functionality and Selenium for web interface testing, if applicable.

6. Deployment with Minikube
Summary:
Deploy the application to a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube. Install and start Minikube, create Kubernetes manifests for deployment and services, and apply them to the cluster.

7. Configuration Management with Ansible or Chef
Summary:
Automate server configuration and deployment using Ansible or Chef. Develop playbooks or recipes to handle installation and deployment tasks.

## In Detail Explantion

# Data Analytics Application

## Overview

This project is a Python-based data analytics application designed to analyze sample data and provide insights via a web interface. It leverages Docker for containerization, Minikube for local Kubernetes orchestration, and Jenkins for CI/CD automation. Additionally, the project includes automated testing using Pytest and optional Selenium tests for the web interface.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for the application.
- **Flask**: Web framework (optional, if using a web interface).
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation library.
- **Docker**: Containerization.
- **Minikube**: Local Kubernetes orchestration.
- **Jenkins**: CI/CD automation.
- **Pytest**: Automated testing.
- **Selenium**: Browser automation for web interface testing (optional).
- **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitoring (BONUS).

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-analytics-app.git
cd data-analytics-app
```

### 2. Set Up Python Environment

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Build and Run the Docker Container

Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t data-analytics-app .
```

Run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 data-analytics-app
```

### 4. Run the Application

If using Flask, navigate to `http://localhost:5000` in your browser to view the application.

## Running Tests

### 1. Pytest

To run unit tests with Pytest, use the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

### 2. Selenium (Optional)

If you have Selenium tests set up, make sure you have the required browser drivers installed (e.g., ChromeDriver) and then run:

```bash
pytest tests/test_selenium.py
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Jenkins Configuration

1. **Set Up Jenkins:**
   - Install Jenkins on your server or local machine.
   - Install necessary plugins (Docker, GitHub).

2. **Create a Jenkins Pipeline Job:**
   - Create a new pipeline job in Jenkins.
   - Point to the GitHub repository containing the `Jenkinsfile`.

### Jenkinsfile

The `Jenkinsfile` automates the CI/CD pipeline. It includes stages for building, testing, Docker image creation, and deploying to Minikube.

## Deployment

### 1. Set Up Minikube

Start Minikube:

```bash
minikube start
```

### 2. Deploy to Minikube

Apply Kubernetes manifests:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
```
